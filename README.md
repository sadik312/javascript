The village of Meadowfield consists of 11 places with 14 roads between them.
The network of roads forms a graph.
A graph is a collection of points (in this case, places in the village) with lines between them (roads).
The graph will be the world the robot moves through.

This can be described using this array of roads:
```
const roads = [
    "Alice's House-Bob's House", "Alice's House-Cabin",
    "Alice's House-Post Office", "Bob's House-Town Hall",
    "Daria's House-Ernie's House", "Daria's House-Town Hall",
    "Ernie's House-Grete's House", "Grete's House-Farm"
    "Grete's House-Shop", "Marketplace-Farm",
    "Marketplace-Post Office", "Marketplace-Shop",
    "Marketplace-Town Hall", "Shop-Town Hall"
]
